				<h2>Solar panels</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
                The term solar panel is used colloquially for a photo-voltaic (PV) module. A PV module is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells mounted in a framework for installation. Photo-voltaic cells use sunlight as a source of energy and generate direct current electricity. A collection of PV modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. Arrays of a photovoltaic system supply solar electricity to electrical equipment. The most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is solar water heating systems.

				<h2>Charge controller</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
			A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current is added to or drawn from electric
			batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a
			safety risk. It may also prevent completely draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the
			battery technology, to protect battery life. The terms "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a stand-alone device,
			or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered device, or battery charger.

				<h2>Battery system</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
			A battery management system (BMS) is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery (cell or battery pack), such as by protecting
			the battery from operating outside its safe operating area, monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data,
			controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or balancing it. A battery pack built together with a battery management system
			with an external communication data bus is a smart battery pack. A smart battery pack must be charged by a smart battery charger.

				<h2>DC power</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
			Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of
			DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even
			through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating
			current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.

				<h2>Inverter</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
                A power inverter, or inverter, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC source. A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects (such as a rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion process.

				<h2>AC power</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
			Instantaneous power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit. In alternating current
			circuits, energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow.
			The portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle of the AC waveform, results in net transfer of energy in one direction is
			known as active power (more commonly called real power to avoid ambiguity especially in discussions of loads with non-sinusoidal currents).
			The portion of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as instantaneous reactive power,
			and its amplitude is the absolute value of reactive power
